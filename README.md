This report was created for a unit on SIEMs and in particular Splunk.

We were tasked with analyzing a security incident of corporate sabotage that happened to the fictional VSI industries commited by the Job Corp. 

The task was to ingest 4 sets of log data from Windows and Apache servers to uncover the extent of the incident as well as put in place remediations to be properly alerted by Splunk of an ongoing attack avoiding the dreaded alert fatigue.

We spend 3 weeks total at first learning the ins and outs of Splunk and ingesting logs. It was not until the project of analyzing the security incident that crafting a response based on a data driven approach is absolutely essential in a defensive toolkit. 
Equally, a considerable part of the project is also the data visualizations to appropriately inform different stakeholders who may not be as fluent in the language of cybersecurity. The data visualizations along with the dashboard really bring data vizualizations 
to a whole new level of access and understanding with the single pane of glass approach Splunk expertly designs.

Included in this respository are the review questions we were required to answer along with the data vizualizations we created from the data.
